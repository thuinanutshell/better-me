# BetterMe
Become a better person and build better habits/lifestyles based on A/B testing principles. In science, to make a conclusion about the effect of a treatment, we need to carefully divide the target of treatment into two groups (treatment and control) and keep all the independent variables similar except for one that we want to measure the impact of our treatment on. The same applies to business. When you want to measure if the change in the layout or the user flow actually affects the retention rate or the time that users spend on a website, you have to keep other components constant except for one. I am curious how we can apply this principle to our lives to uncover the patterns and make interventions to make them better.
